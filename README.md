You can save your output by pressing the 's' key, while your cursor is inside the 'Adjustable Arc Image Converter' window.
You can quit the program by pressing the 'esc' key, while your cursor is inside the 'Adjustable Arc Image Converter' window.

When the output image is displayed on a screen you will notice the distorted image.

   Displaying the newly created image properly:
      1 Take a print out of the image, or re-orent your display screen so it is parrellel with the ground, display side facing up.
      2 Place a mirrored cylinder or other reflective cylinder in the area of the image with the smallest radius.
      3 The viewer must be viewing the out put on the cylinder. 
	This is best seen when the viewers line of sight is parallel to the cylinder.
